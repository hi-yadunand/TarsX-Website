                                <p>The inspiration for TarsX came from watching Interstellar and being captivated by TARS—a robot that was both functional and had personality. Unlike typical movie robots, TARS was designed to be practical, reliable, and even humorous.</p>
                                <p>What started as a simple "wouldn't it be cool if..." conversation evolved into a full-fledged project. The challenge wasn't just about building a robot that looked like TARS, but one that could actually function, move, and interact in meaningful ways.</p>
                                <p>Throughout this journey, we've encountered countless obstacles—from mechanical design challenges to software integration issues. Each problem solved has been a learning opportunity, pushing us to think creatively and find innovative solutions.</p>
                                <p>The project has grown beyond just building a robot. It's become a community effort, with contributors sharing ideas, code, and support. This collaborative spirit is what makes TarsX special—it's not just a project, it's a movement.</p>

                                <p>Welcome to the TarsX build log. This comprehensive guide will walk you through every aspect of building your own TARS replica, from initial planning to final assembly.</p>
                                <p>TarsX is designed to be modular and accessible.

                            <div class="section-content">
                                <p>One of the most fascinating aspects of TARS is its unique mechanical design. Unlike traditional humanoid robots, TARS uses a modular block system that allows for incredible flexibility and stability.</p>
                                <h3>Key Mechanical Features</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Modular Block Design:</strong> Each segment can move independently, allowing for complex configurations</li>
                                    <li><strong>Wide Base Stability:</strong> The rectangular base provides excellent stability for various positions</li>
                                    <li><strong>Precision Joints:</strong> High-torque servos enable smooth, controlled movements</li>
                                    <li><strong>Weight Distribution:</strong> Careful placement of components ensures balance in all configurations</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3>Movement Capabilities</h3>
                                <p>TarsX can achieve several key movements inspired by the original TARS:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Standing upright in a rectangular configuration</li>
                                    <li>Folding into a compact form for storage</li>
                                    <li>Reconfiguring segments for different tasks</li>
                                    <li>Stable movement across various terrains</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Early prototypes revealed that the mechanical design needed to balance between flexibility and structural integrity. Too much flexibility meant instability, while too much rigidity limited movement capabilities. The final design represents an optimal compromise.</p>
